Introduction
This project aims to use machine learning techniques to analyze educational data and predict various performance outcomes. The Random Forest Regressor model is used for prediction after applying feature engineering techniques such as interaction terms and polynomial features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided in an Excel file named output.xlsx. It contains the following columns:

Technology Acceptance
Level of use of AI based tools
Technology based Tutoring System
Organisational Performance
Student's Performance
Ranges for the above columns
Feature Engineering
We perform feature engineering to create additional features from the original dataset:

Interaction terms between numerical features.
Polynomial features (squared terms) for numerical features.
Model Training
The model used is a Random Forest Regressor. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best model. The training and evaluation include the following steps:

Encoding the target variables using ordinal encoding.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training the model with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluating the model performance on the test set.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model is evaluated using:

R-squared (RÂ²)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
joblib
openpyxl
You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib openpyxl
Usage
Place the output.xlsx file in the same directory as the script.
Run the script to perform feature engineering and train the model:
bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
The script will generate an augmented dataset and save the best Random Forest Regressor model as random_forest_model.joblib.
